# Project Overview

## Project Name

Gacha Gaming

## Project Description

Gacha Gaming is a recreation of what it feels like to play gacha games(lootbox games), by using React and Airtable to create a limited pool of characters you can draw from. The higher the rarity of a character the lower percentage chance you have of getting the character. All characters will have stats and art, but the rarer they get the better they become. Airtable will be used to store the characters the user can pull. The user than will be put into battle using the character that they have pulled, and the victories and defeats of the character will be recorded on airtable.

- Pulls the character data off Airtable and displays it
- Uses character data and pits it off against an opposing enemies data.

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add Music
- Add higher and lower odds of rolling characters based off rarity
- Add sound effects
- Add animations

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|July 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|July 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|July 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|July 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|July 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|July 16| MVP | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
-Has a firm understanding on what the logical flow should be

### Weaknesses:
-Doesnt have a firm grasp on how to implement video game mechanics yet
-Not confident on how to add percentage chance to a randomized grab from the JSON
-Not to strong working with CSS

### Opportunities:
-Learn Game Mechanics
-Gain additional knowledge on how to work with Animations

### Threats:
-May be pressured for time
